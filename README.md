SailfishOS app for showing news photos

Show a slide show of 10 news photos from The Guardian, "Photo highlights of the day", and also from Der Spiegel, "Bilder des Tages". Unfortunately Dutch NOS website stopped early May 2021 with the photo series "Nieuws in beeld", which all started this app.

At the bottom of the website of Dutch broadcasting company NOS, 10 very beautiful photos were being shown as "Nieuws in beeld". But it was a bother to load the website and to scroll down every time. So this app was created to show you the photos on your Sailfish device, with their titles, description and source.

The Guardian appeared to publish daily photos as well, so these are being shown as well.

Der Spiegel recently started with a page, publishing only one photo per day. This page shows over 30 photos now, so in Settings you can set the number of photos to be shown. (Text from Der Spiegel will be in German.)

NOS stopped their service, so Dutch news paper de Volkskrant was added. Less than one new photo a day.

Thanks to SanderKlootwijk! I used his Nednieuws code to shape my News Photos app. The About Page was heavily inspired by (or simply taken from) Damien Tardy-Panis's Daily Comics.
